##  Overview

This project implements a **personalized product recommendation system** using **Collaborative Filtering** with the **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** algorithm in PySpark.  
It analyzes historical customer purchase behavior to recommend the **Top-5 most relevant products** for each user.  
A **Streamlit-based UI** is included for interaction, allowing users to select a customer and instantly view recommended products.

##  Key Features

-  Collaborative Filtering with ALS  
-  Works efficiently on large datasets using **PySpark**
-  Automated data cleaning & preprocessing
-  Personalized **Top-5 recommendation prediction**
-  Interactive UI built with **Streamlit**
-  Option to export recommendations to CSV

---

##  Project Motivation

Modern e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, Netflix) rely heavily on recommendation systems to:

- Improve customer engagement  
- Increase conversions and sales  
- Personalize user experience  

This project demonstrates how machine learning and real dataset analysis can replicate such systems.
